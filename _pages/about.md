Hi! My name is Sijia Li (李思佳). I am currently a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) fortunate to be advised [Prof. Huaicheng Li](https://huaicheng.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my master's and bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zuqing Zhu](http://www.zuqingzhu.info/).

My research interests lie broadly in the areas of operating systems and networks, with a recent focus on shared memory systems.

Extracurricularly, I also enjoy running and swimming.
