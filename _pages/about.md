Hi! I am Sijia Li. I am currently a 3rd year master's student in [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn) (USTC), advised by [Prof. Zuqing Zhu](https://www.zuqingzhu.info). I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering from USTC in Jul 2020.

My research are in the board areas of operating systems and networks, with a recent focus on memory systems.

Extracurricularly, I also enjoy running and swimming.
