  abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) enables flexi- ble, cost-effective, and timely deployment of new network services in elastic optical networks (EONs). Nowadays, the integration of cloud and edge computing becomes a prevailing trend, which has promoted the idea of edge-cloud EON (EC-EON) (i.e., a multi- domain EON that consists of a cloud domain and one or more edge domains). In this work, we study the dynamic provision- ing of virtual network function based service chain (VNF-SC) requests in EC-EONs, and leverage game theory to explain why and how the cloud and edge domain managers (DMs) should collaborate when protecting their own interests. We first formulate the non-cooperative interactions between cloud and edge DMs as a two-stage Stackelberg game, prove the existence of Nash Equilib- rium in the game, and propose an algorithm based on backward induction for the non-cooperative service provisioning. Next, we address the cooperative provisioning scheme where the DMs can reach an agreement for mutual benefit, and model it with Nash bargaining. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to compare the non-cooperative and cooperative provisioning schemes with the traditional centralized approach in EC-EONs in-depth. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our non-cooperative and cooper- ative provisioning schemes on protecting the interests of DMs, and suggest that the cooperative provisioning scheme can outperform the traditional centralized approach in terms of blocking probabil- ity, when inter- and intra-domain VNF-SC requests both exist in an EC-EON.},

abstract = {We address the challenge of provisioning dynamic requests in a wavelength-switched optical network (WSON) built with coherent point-to-multipoint transceivers (P2MP-TRXs) in this work. An efficient heuristic for transceiver, routing, and spec- trum assignment (TRSA) is proposed, along with a subcarrier (SC) level proactive defragmentation method that can further enhance the provisioning performance through reconfiguring the spectrum allocations of leaf P2MP-TRXs. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of our proposals.},
